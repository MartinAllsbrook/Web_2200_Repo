        <p>Vsauce is an educational youtube channel started by Michael Stevens on June 24, 2010.
          Vsauce has now expanded into an entire team and consists of three channels Vsauce 1, 2, and 3.
          Interestingly the name "Vsauce" originally came from a random name generator Michael was playing with.</p>

        <p>Michael Stevens, the original host of Vsauce, is a very eccentric man who became very popular for his funny faces and unique style in his videos.
        Many screenshots and parodies of the ways he acts have been spread on the internet and a few are included below and above</p>

        <h2>Mind Field</h2>
        <img src="assets/vsaucemindfield.jpg" style="width:20vw" alt="Advertisement for the Mind Field Show"/>
        <p>Mind Field was a youtube original show based on the style of Vsauce and hosted by Michael Stevens.
        Originally there was massive backlash against Michael for making paid educational content but all episodes of mind field have since been made free with ads.</p>
